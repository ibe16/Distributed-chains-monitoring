# Online monitoring systems of distributed manufacturing chains.

The aim of this work is done from the convergence between information technologies and operational technologies. The project has some objectives that it is needed to achieve for the company with we have worked, EbroFoods. These objectives include the realization of a guide to help other engineers to introduce themselves in industrial world, the replication of the company's work environment and a comparison of the different tools that are being considered for use it in the company.

First to all, a study will be done about the production process and the data extraction that are carried out in them. The study will analyze the different elements that we found during this process and the role they play. In addition, it will be seen how they are used and how all of them are interconnected.

Then, fulfilling one of the main objectives, we will proceed to the replication of the company's work environment. To achieve this, the tools EbroFoods uses nowadays will be studied. Also,a comparison will be made in order to analyze new tools for its use in the company. Finally,we will have a planning using the SCRUM methodology to organize the development of the project.

The development of the project is based on the creation of a system that allows collecting data from the processing plants and to control the machines that exits in each of the lines. In order to do this, one of the tools previously studied will be selected and tested in the work environment with the aim of checking its performance. Finally, conclusions will be made about the results of the project and the importance they have,to chain with the second part of the work.
